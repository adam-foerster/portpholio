						<h2>The Digital Packing List</h2>
						<p>
							The Digital Packing List Project uses React JS to create a good
							user experience for adding, subtracting, packing, and tracking
							items on your packing list before you travel. I made this project
							while working on a React-based course on Udemy by Jonas
							Schmmedten. This was my first real project using the React JS
							framework, and because of this, it was difficult to understand
							what exactly was happening with the use of state. But in the end,
							I understood more about how the React JS framework works.

					<pre>
						<code>const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
							root.render(
								&lt;React.StrictMode>
								&lt;App />
								&lt;React.StrictMode>
							);
						</code>

						<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
						<p>
							When creating this project there were a few goals that I had in
							mind:
							<br />
							1. Create a web application using the current React Standards
							<br />
							2. Create a easily understood application that allows for the
							adding, deleting, completing, saving, and loading of a list to be
							used for packing for a trip.
						</p>

						<h2>But Why?</h2>
						<p>
							As I was creating this project it took me a while to realize who
							was ever going to use it. It was a chance for me to learn the
							react framework yes, but what was its purpose. And then it hit me,
							Almost literally, I almost knocked my waterbottle onto my foot.
							This project didn't need to be for anything other than to help me
							learn. Now that doesn't mean that I shouldn't pay attention to the
							process so that if anyone did just happen to discover it they
							wouldn't understand it but that I should focus on learning and
							then afterwards turn it into something usable just in case someone
							happens upon it.
						</p>
					</div>
					<pre>
						<code>export default function Form({ onAddItems }) {
							const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
							const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
						...

						<h2>So it Begins</h2>
						<p>
							Starting out, I had learned some of the basics of react. I
							understood the basic of state, components, and props and it was
							time to put all of it together in a way that allowed each of them
							to show off their uses and abilities. Components are the
							containers, the physical objects that are shown and rendered to
							the screen. Props are the physical data that is passed into and
							out of those componencts. And finally, State is the mastermind of
							it all. State, is the ability to store those props, update them
							via functions, and then automatically rerender those components
							without the need to refresh or reboot the entire program. By using
							state you save on load times, and have automatically reactive
							websites and web applications. Now why does that matter? Well,
							because showing this and using it is what this process is all
							about. It all started with data. What data am I storing, and what
							do I do with it once I have it. That part was farely simple, I was
							creating a packing list web application anyway. The data that was
							getting was going to be items that needed to be packed, how many
							of them, and then whether they had been packed already. This was a
							great use for props and lists. By having an input box, take in
							information, a drop down with numbers, and a simple submit button,
							using state, we are able to take that information, map it to a
							list, and then pass that data using props into the visible
							component. That there is the basics of this project. It is what
							happened after this that was the most interesting. After
							everything was said and done, all the components looked good, and
							the data was being stored updated and changed properly, it was
							finished. This was actually where the course I was taken moved
							onto other things. But I wasn't finished, what about savings,
							sharing and your packing lists. There had to be a way that you
							could save your lists to your system and then behind the scenes
							have it so that you could pull back up your packing list right.
							And the answer is not really. One of the downsides of react is the
							inability to access system files. That didn't stop me though. With
							some help, I was able to create a way to download your packing
							list to your computer, and then upload one back up to it. Now this
							isn't the most eloquent of options, but it does function properly
							to an extent.

						<h2>The Final Product</h2>
						<p>
							In the end I was able to learn the basics of React JS. While doing
							so I created a website that both functional and helped me to
							learn.

						<h2>What's Next?</h2>
						<p>
							Looking back at this project, It was a rather smooth process.
							There were times when I got frustrated at myself not learning fast
							enough, or the limitations to what some frameworks offer, but it
							helped me realize that everything has it's ups and downs. It's
							benefits and it's downsides. If I could go back and talk to myself
							as I was creating it, I would tell myself to spend more time
							trying it out. Play around, have fun with it. You don't need to
							worry about it being perfect, it is more important to learn and
							more importantly understand why something works, than the fact
							that it does work.
