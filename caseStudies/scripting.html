					<h2>Scripting for Web</h2>
					<p>
						When working on the internet, most websites and web applications
						have a purpose. There are very few pages and applications that just
						exist and do nothing. Often it is needed for these websites and
						applications to grab data from an existing data set and then
						presenting it in some sort of way. During this project, I use
						javascript to grab and present data from a premade data set all
						about star wars starships. This was done while working in my
						Scripting for Internet Technolagy class with Thor Anderson.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="goals">
					<h2>But Why?</h2>
					<p>
						The whole purpose of this website was to better understand the
						process and uses of scripting data in web applications and sites. It
						was made specifically for us to understand the reasoning why and how
						we can best do this for our future references.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="process">
					<h2>Working Through It</h2>
					<p>
						While working on this project it was an interesting process trying
						to work out how exactly to present the information to the users. We
						were able to import to successfully import the data from our
						specific separate data file and get it into a usable state. From
						there we grabbed the images, title and then some additional
						information such as max-speed, amount of passengers, and hyperdrive
						rating.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most difficult part of this project was taking that additional
						information, and presenting them in a list that makes sense. Getting
						the data scripting each as separate list items in an unordered list.
						I kept getting data that I didn’t want put into the list, or it not
						appearing at all. What I found to be happening was the logic that I
						was using to get the data was reaching outside of the scope of the
						data leading it to show me information that I wasn’t looking for or
						needing, or just causing it to not appear at all. After figuring
						this out, I decided that I would process the data in opposite
						fashion meaning that I would set specific properties to skip instead
						of getting specific items to present. By doing so, I could use a
						multi condtinoal if statement to specifically skip the properties
						that I wasn’t wanting to see.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="product">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						After finishing it up, I was able to create a basic website that
						took the data collected and the presented it to the users. You can
						find it at the following website.
						https://personal-profile-app.netlify.app/starships/.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="nextTime">
					<h2>Looking Back</h2>
					<p>
						Looking back this was a great learning experience in scripting data
						for web use. As I look at the website now, I would have tried to
						create a better asthetic for the site, yes the yellow, white, and
						stary night look good in theme, visually, it isn’t that appealing. I
						would have preferred to create something that isn’t fully in theme,
						but looks more visually appealing. I would have also loved to use
						the conditional statements to change the property names to be more
						readable and less code language, but that will be for next time.
