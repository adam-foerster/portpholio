					<h2>IS&T</h2>
					<p>
						The Redesign of the IS&T Website was a project that I worked on
						while in the Interaction Design Practicum Class here at UVU with
						Tressa Hopkinson. In this class, we were tasked with helping the
						IS&T department do research in regards to the redesign of their
						website. We worked as teams and worked on creating a design that
						would best help a specific persona that we chose.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="goals">
					<h2>What were we doing?</h2>
					<p>
						As we started working on this project, it wasn't very clear what the
						overall goal of it was. We were told we were working on a redesign,
						but that we shouldn't focus on the redesign and more focus on the
						research on our specific personas. And so, that is what we spent the
						most time on throughout the process.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="audience">
					<h2>Our Persona</h2>
					<p>
						The Persona that we chose was that of the prospective master's
						student. We then worked on creating an imaginary person who would
						become the generic master's student that we could have in mind as we
						did research and the redesign.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h2>Researching and Working as a team</h2>
					<p>
						With our audience directly in mind, we started by doing some
						quantitative research. We needed to reach people and understand
						questions like why are they wanting to become a master's student,
						what would they look for in a website, and those things that are
						most important on a website for them. So, we created a survey and
						sent it off to anyone and everyone that we could find who is a
						masters student, was a masters student, or is a prospective masters
						student. And the results didn't really surprise us. Most People who
						were looking at receiving a masters degree, were looking at it for
						mainly 1 of 3 reasons. 1. In order to further progress higher up in
						their field of work. 2. In order to receive a higher paying
						salary/job. Or 3. Looking at becoming more specialized in their
						current field. Below you can see some of our results. From there we
						wanted to know some information about the current IS&T site, and so
						we did some qualitative research by doing some eye tracking. We
						wanted to see what on the current site was working when giving a
						user a task, vs. what was drawing their attention away from it as
						they were working on the same task. It was here where we found some
						issues. The biggest gripe that was had with the current website was
						the landing page was cluttered and didn't have the information
						people were expecting it to have, and overall the overall navigation
						didn't end up leading people to where it was supposed to. So, that
						is where we started. We went to other department websites and found
						their navigation options, we looked into landing designs and overall
						pictures and finally went into the wireframes. From wire frames, we
						then went onto surface comps and prototyping. But this is about
						where we hit our first road bump. You see about halfway through this
						process, my father passed away. And my focus completely disappeared
						along with my last few functioning brain cells. At this time, I had
						been working on a lot of the presentation of the research we had
						performed and was gearing up to continue with eye tracking. But with
						this major life event, tasks needed to be reassigned amongst our
						team, and we needed to get stuff fingered out. With the wonderful
						team that I was working with, we were able to keep on moving. Slower
						than before, but moving nonetheless. When I was ready to get back to
						work, we were starting on the prototyping. Getting a design ready
						and active so that we could do some usability testing. But it was at
						this time, when our next road bump showed up. The IS&T department
						had a group of web designers and developers working on new designs
						in the background while we were doing our research and updated their
						website with a new design as we were almost finishing up. With that,
						it was really hard to stay focused with our designs. Knowing that in
						the end, none of it really mattered anymore was a little sad and
						demotivating, but we did our best to push through and move on with
						those usability tests. With our Usability testing, we found that for
						the most part, the new designs made since, and working slightly
						better than the original website.And with that the project was
						finished.

					<h2>Final Product</h2>
					<p>
						As we finished up, we did have a successfully redesigned website,
						and plenty of research to show why we chose to do what we did. Even
						though Our designs were no longer applicable, it was good to know
						that they were a sign of our hard work, and effort.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="nextTime">
					<h2>Looking Back</h2>
					<p>
						In the end this was a good learning experience for me. This was not
						only the first time that I had really worked for a client, but also
						the first time that I had really worked in a team. But, there are a
						few things that I would change if I had the opportunity to go back.
						I personally feel that we didn't fully understand our demographic
						and persona. Even with all the research, I still feel like there is
						a major part of the demographic we had missed. I would love to have
						been able to get more research, and then fully understand what our
						demographic was looking for, and what they were wanting with their
						work.
