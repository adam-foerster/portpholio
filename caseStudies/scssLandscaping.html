						<h2>SCSS Landscaping</h2>
						<p>
							The SCSS Landscaping page is a website where I experimented and
							tested out the abilities and uses of SCSS in the DWDD 2610 course
							here at UVU. SCSS or Sassy Cascading Style Sheets, is a
							preprocessor for CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, which allows for the
							compression and minimizing of your CSS files. SCSS has a lot of
							abilities that aren't found within CSS such as style nesting and
							mix-in functions for reusability.

						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<p>
							As I was making this site, the whole premise given to us was to
							learn how to create a sliding interactive hero image. This
							seemingly small aspect of a webpage that you see everywhere seemed
							such a daunting task to me as I was starting out.
						</p>

				<section class="process caseStudy">
					<div class="caseStudyText">
						<h2>Process</h2>
						<p>
							With the creation of the website as a whole, it started out pretty
							simply. I didn't need to worry about any other pages, or any major
							decorations, and so I was able to quickly get that done. After
							that, I grabbed some AI generated images for the slider and got to
							work. It all started with the layout. How exactly was this slider
							going to be organized in the HTML? A simple question really, but
							then you need to realize that we needed to have 4 separate images,
							all stored and available for use at a moment's notice, with only
							one displayed at a time. Which after thinking about it, seemed
							easier than I anticipated. The HTML itself wasn't going to be
							controlling the slider, the JS was. Javascript even has several
							modules made specifically for this purpose. By using one of those,
							it would save time and effort in getting it worked out. Once
							again, the lesson I learned back during my typescript course is
							standing out to me. Sometimes the simplest answer is the best.
							After realizing that, it only took a few bits of research to find
							a good swiper to use, install it via npm, and then use the module
							to get it working.

						<code>//Large SCSS
							#primaryNav{
							position: relative;
							display: flex;
							flex-direction: row;
							gap: .5rem;
							justify-content: right;
							width: 100%;
							border: none;
							border-bottom: 1px solid $fontColor;
						}

						//Small SCSS
						nav{
							font-weight: $boldWeight;
							//button stuff
							button{
								height: 44px;
								width: 44px;
								background: none;
								border: none;
								position: relative;
							}
						}
						</code>
					</pre>

						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>
							After I got that finished up the page was complete. It had a
							working slider that cycles through 4 photos, while still allowing
							for the ability to choose which photo you are wanting to look at.

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>
							As I look back at this project, there are a few things that I
							would have done differently. I would have wanted to try and add
							more to the page than just what was required. Going in and
							practicing what I knew previously, working on each aspect of that
							I had learned previously and then used this as an opportunity to
							refresh and develop my skills some more.
