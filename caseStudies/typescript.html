						<h2>Understanding Typescript</h2>
						<p>
							Typescript is a good bridge between object-oriented programming
							and the prototype-based programming language of Javascript. The
							Intro to TypeScript Project uses Typescript to present some basic
							information about Typescript to the users by creating a beginner
							friendly source of information for anyone to use. I created this
							project while learning typescript in the Intro to Typescript Class
							at UVU with Thor Anderson. While learning typescript, it was a
							good experience, especially coming from a JavaScript background
							with a little understanding of the more object oriented
							programming languages.

						<h2>What is this about?</h2>
						<p>
							As I began working on the exploring typescript project there were
							2 main goals that I had. Present some basic information about
							typescript in a way that anyone with minimal coding experience
							could understand by using examples and code snippets to share
							information Use typescript to write a responsive and customized
							website that follows current typescript standards and is
							deployable on all devices and systems With these goals in mind, I
							set off to learn typescript and grow along the way.

						<h2>Entering the world of Typescript</h2>
						<p>
							irst a few questions came up, what exactly was I wanting to
							present and who was I looking at presenting it to. Using these
							questions, It was soon realized that typescript isn't something
							that anyone can just jump into and understand, there is some basic
							background knowledge that is needed before one can understand the
							“meat” that is typescript. Knowing this, it was decided that I
							would try and bridge the gap between the basic understanding one
							can have with Javascript and the deeper capabilities and
							strictness that is offered within Typescript by targeting those
							individuals, such as myself, who were looking at learning the
							basics of typescript as well. That way we could share the
							information that we needed to without needing to cover the basics
							of Javascript.

						<h2>How it went</h2>
						<p>
							With our audience now clearly in mind I set forth on our grand
							quest learning and growing along the way. The first thing I
							started on was learning the core of what typescript is, Data
							Types. I worked on this first because it is these data types that
							really make typescript what it is by adding a level of structure
							to the loose language of JavaScript . From there I went onto the
							use of data types within functions, in ways such as specifying
							parameter and return types. Next was the the implamantation of
							classes and interfaces, which allow for the structure of larger
							portions of code as well as the inheritance of certain aspects.
							Then finishing up with generics, which allow for the reusablility
							of functions when multiple types are needed. This path that I
							worked on is not only the way that I learned typescript, but also
							the way I presented it to the users.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, this doesn't mean that there weren't hiccups along the way. A
							prime example of this was while working on classes. I really
							wanted to get a content observer set up on my classes page that
							had information coming into and out of the screen, this way, it
							was engaging and fun all at the same time. This content observer
							gave me so much grief and stress trying to get the observer to
							look at exactly what I was wanting it to. But it taught me
							sometimes it doesn't need to be complicated and that sometimes the
							simplest answer is the best option.
						</p>
						<p>
							The story behind this is that as I was making it, I was dead set
							on having it target each function automatically via some sort of
							loop and list grabbing the id and presenting it onto the screen.
							This method though possible was something that at my current stage
							of understanding, I wasn't ready for. And so after trying and
							trying to understand it, I eventually realized it was above my
							skill at that time, and should be something I focus on in the
							future. After finally realizing this, I switched it over to a
							manual targeting system where I put in the Id's myself and had the
							observer watch for each section based on those individually.

						<h2>Looking Back</h2>
						<p>
							Though we didn't have time in the class to test it out looking
							back, there are a few things that I would have done differently.
							But at the time I was making it, I was content with how it came
							out. Some of those things I would do differently would be to have
							all the different options be presented in a similar way in order
							to keep it consistent, and then as well change the overall layout
							to be more stylistic and clean. I learned not just typescript but
							also some skills about diving deeper into a language for myself
							and I learned that simplicity within code often makes something
							the easiest to understand.
