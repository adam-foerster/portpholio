						<h2>Learning WordPress</h2>
						<p>
							Learning Wordpress Wordpress is one of the worlds largest Content
							Management Systems(CMS) in use today, and is used in roughly 43%
							of all websites that are being hosted today. With such a large and
							important software, it is important to understand just how it is
							used and why people all over the world are using it to run their
							websites. During a 16 week long semester at UVU, I was able to
							learn more about wordpress and host a site managed by wordpress
							through Amazon Web Services (AWS). By the end of those 16 weeks, I
							was hoping to be able to better understand how to implement a
							custom theme into wordpress using SFTP (secure file transfer
							protocol), learn some of the most popular and useful plugins for
							wordpress, and ultimately build a site that has all the basic
							necessities that a fictional business would need to have a basic
							online store.

						<h2>Getting Started with AWS</h2>
						<p>
							It all started with first understanding AWS and the online
							hosting. If I couldn't get my code into AWS to be hosted, then
							there would be no way to get it into wordpress. After looking into
							what different options were available, I decided to simply use
							AWS's sub tool S3 buckets. They work by allowing you to directly
							drop your files into a 'bucket' and then they would use those
							files to host the site. And so my fake Business Expo Parties was
							made, and you can still see the very basic home page to this day
							at http://expogamingparties.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/#.

						<h2>Moving to WordPress with Lightsail</h2>
						<p>
							From there I went and learned more about Wordpress. Now that I
							could get information into AWS it was time to see about linking it
							to wordpress to host my site. That is where another tool from AWS
							comes in hand, "Lightsail". Lightsail is a tool offered by AWS
							that allows users to create a new instance of wordpress, and have
							it be hosted through AWS. It will even allow you to connect to it
							using SSH, and SFTP so that as you work in your separate coding
							interface, you can link it to automatically sync to your site.
							Using those tools, I quickly moved over from using S3 buckets to
							Lightsail. We got the SSH key, Username and password and linked
							out STFT to allow for the site to update our theme automatically.
							From there we then disabled the 2 default editors that wordpress
							has to offer and deleted all the preinstalled plugins. With that
							clean slate, I started working on my theme.

						<h2>Theme Development</h2>
						<p>
							It started by adding the empty theme to the wordpress site and
							then implementing it on the page. From there I began working in
							SCSS to build a basic responsive site that had both wayfinding,
							feedback, and basic functionality. The theme was worked on
							throughout the entire rest of the project as needed. But when it
							was to the point where it was sufficient I was able to go in and
							start creating each page through wordpress.

						<h2>Building Pages and Plugins</h2>
						<p>
							A few things to point out, is I did end up installing a handful of
							plugins, things like Contact Form 7, Flamingo, Honeypot, WP New
							and Scrolling, and wooComerce all to better understand how the
							wordpress plugins worked. After several weeks of working on it, it
							was at the point where there wasn't much more to do. As a fake
							site and business It didn't need to look perfect, but function
							properly. Expo Parties can be found live at this Address:

						<h2>Second Project: Gather In Taste</h2>
						<p>
							But that wasn't all, after I was done with that, there was one
							more page that I wanted to build, another business site with a
							very basic layout with minimal functionality. This one for Gather
							In Taste. A real business that my aunt was working on getting
							started. From what I learned with Expo Gaming parties, I threw
							together a simple design that had all the necessary features for
							what she was looking for. Shortly there after, there wasn't much
							effort put into it for the business perspective and the page never
							went public nor was it refined. Here is the site today:
							<a href="http://34.214.21.202/">http://34.214.21.202/</a>

						<h2>Reflections and Future Improvements</h2>
						<p>
							If I could go back, I would want to refine both of these sites a
							little more with the further knowledge that I've learned. I think
							both of there overall design is very simple and could use a little
							more variety and color. But overall the purpose of these 2
							projects wasn't to make a stylish page, but to understand how to
							implement a custom theme into wordpress. Do I wish my theme was a
							little more comprehensive, yes, yes I do, and maybe one day I will
							go back and fix it.
