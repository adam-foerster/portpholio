						<h2>Preparing media for Web Use</h2>
						<p>
							When working online, there is always a use for images. We see
							images all over the pace. From websites, to news articles, images
							are used everywhere. And ensuring that these images are presented
							in the best and most efficient way is an integral part of
							developing for a website. In this project we did just that, we
							explored the different formats of images and their respective
							sizes.

						<h2>What is this about?</h2>
						<p>
							When starting out, It was first time to understand the different
							types of images, and how their storage sizes interacted with each
							other. And so we got into the research. We learned about the
							different file types starting with RAW files that contain no
							compression, then to the different compressed image formats such
							as JPG, and WebP. We also looked into how quality effected the
							overall image size.

						<h2>Going At it</h2>
						<p>
							As I started out, it made since to start with a uncompressed RAW
							image file. These photos, I took myself and used different
							compression tools to find which format and file type would lead to
							the lowest file size with the best quality of image.
						</p>
						<p>
							These images started as 4k images and both were around 10 MB
							large. The first compression settings I used were the photoshop
							JPEG compression. This was probably the most frustrating process I
							did. As I went through the compression options, it seemed that
							Photoshop had a different compression algorithms for each of the
							different export and save options.
						</p>
						<p>
							This lead me to go through each one of them looking to see what
							options where available for each, and what quality settings were
							available with each option. This process took the longest of all
							of them as there seemed to be more and more options available the
							longer that I went into it. Something that I found out though is
							that mid high quality, and high quality have no difference when it
							comes to overall image appearance. As an example of this quality
							level 8 in the export as options of photoshop is just as good
							quality as quality level 12 with a significantly lower file size.
						</p>
						<p>
							After that I focused on Webp and the AVIF file types, each of the
							newer file types that have come out. With those compression
							options I exported each of them in the different quality options
							available to find the best spread of data. When looking into WebP
							it was very apparent the lower file sizes with similar quality.
							Same with AVIF, it had a lower file size and similar quality
							available. Each of them though still have their merit and uses.
							With AVIF being a relatively new format, it isnâ€™t implemented on
							older devices, similarly with WebP. So Jpeg is still useful when
							as an option of older devices.

						<h2>What I learned</h2>
						<p>
							What I ended up learning was that image tags in html were no
							longer a really viable option anymore when working with websites.
							We need to provide options for all devices but still give the best
							quality when available. And so, picture tags with subsources are
							the best way to do that. We are able to have the lower files and
							faster loading formats of AVIF and WebP, but still set a default
							image to be JPG so that when the site is loaded on older devices
							the images can still be seen. You can find my documentation on the
							event here.

						<h2>Looking Back</h2>
						<p>
							Looking back, this project was a good experience understanding the
							nuances of images and file formats. If I were to do it again, I
							would want to use different images and track more options than
							just quality differences. I would want to track options such as
							how progressive loading effected wait times, and how some of the
							different options change how he files load.
